# bookmarkgen

the idea is to parse a html file (wiki page) to structured data
persist this data in a database and then do some actions with these data
like:
* genarate hosts files
* generate bookmark html files for
    * firefox
    * chrome

this project should result in a pure backend application (restful microservice)
that communicates with a (whatever) frontend
